# UE4-2D-Platformer-Game-Light-Over-Darkness
Repository for my first Unreal Engine game: a 2D platformer titled "Light Over Darkness". This game was made solely by me, including all of the art, with inspiration from my brother for the game's idea itself. This was made for my Game Dev course at Rowan University. The game was coded and built using Unreal Engine 4 and its Blueprints system.

### To play:
- Download the respository's folders and files
- Go Into Your Computer's File Explorer
- Go Into the "WindowsNoEditor" folder
- Double-Click on the vgpfinal.exe file

**Controls: Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys to Move and the Space Bar to Jump.**
